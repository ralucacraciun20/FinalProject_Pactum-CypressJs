This is the final project containing the PactumJs and Cypress frameworks. It contains test cases covering both a front end application (using Cypress) and APIs (using PactumJs). I used the following urls for tests: API (PactumJS)
https://practice.expandtesting.com/notes/api/api-docs/#/ and  for WEB  (Cypress) https://automationteststore.com/
